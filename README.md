# era5_to_int

A simple Python script for converting ERA5 netCDF files to the WPS intermediate
format

## Overview

The `era5_to_int.py` script converts ERA5 model- or pressure-level netCDF files
to the WRF Pre-processing System (WPS) intermediate file format, permitting the
use of these data with either the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
or the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A).

The only required command-line argument is the date-time, in YYYY-MM-DD_HH
format, of ERA5 files to convert. For example:
```
era5_to_int.py 2024-05-01_00
```

Conversion of a range of date-times is possible through the use of additional
command-line arguments as described in the Usage section.

The following surface fields from the d633 datasets are handled by the script:

| Field   | Dataset | Horiz. grid | Num. levels |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| SOILGEO | [d633000](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/) | ~0.281-deg Gaussian | 1 |

When model-level ERA5 files are being processed (the default), the following
atmospheric fields are handled:

| Field   | Dataset | Horiz. grid | Num. levels |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Q       | [d633006](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633006/) | ~0.281-deg Gaussian | 137 |
| T       | [d633006](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633006/) | ~0.281-deg Gaussian | 137 |
| U       | [d633006](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633006/) | ~0.281-deg Gaussian | 137 |
| V       | [d633006](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633006/) | ~0.281-deg Gaussian | 137 |

Alternatively, if the processing of pressure-level (isobaric) ERA5 files is
selected with the `-i` / `--isobaric` command-line option, the following
atmospheric fields are instead handled:

| Field   | Dataset | Horiz. grid | Num. levels |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Z       | [d633000](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/) | 0.25-deg Lat-Lon | 37 |
| Q       | [d633000](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/) | 0.25-deg Lat-Lon | 37 |
| T       | [d633000](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/) | 0.25-deg Lat-Lon | 37 |
| U       | [d633000](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/) | 0.25-deg Lat-Lon | 37 |
| V       | [d633000](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/) | 0.25-deg Lat-Lon | 37 |

As fields are converted from netCDF to intermediate format, their names are also
converted to match WPS and MPAS-A expectations.

## Requirements
The `era5_to_int.py` script requires:
- Python 3.11+
- netCDF4
- NumPy

## Usage

The only required command-line argument is the date-time, in YYYY-MM-DD_HH
format, of ERA5 model-level files to convert. For example:
```
era5_to_int.py 2024-05-01_00
```

Upon successful completion, an intermediate file with the prefix `ERA5` is
created in the current working directory; for example, `ERA5:2024-05-01_00`.

With no optional arguments, the script will search known paths on the NWSC Glade
filesystem for ERA5 model-level netCDF files. If the `-p`/`--path` option is
provided with a local path, the script will instead search that local path for
ERA5 files that have been downloaded from the NSF NCAR Research Data Archive
(RDA) d633 datasets. For example:
```
era5_to_int.py --path /some/data/directory/era5 2024-05-01_00
```

Processing a range of times is possible by providing as a second positional
argument the date-time until which time records should be converted. For
example, to converted the entire month of May 2024:
```
era5_to_int.py 2024-05-01_00 2024-05-31_18
```

By default, fields are converted at a six-hourly interval, and a different
interval may be specified with a third positional argument. For example, to
convert data at a three-hourly interval for the month of May 2024:
```
era5_to_int.py 2024-05-01_00 2024-05-31_21 3
```

Usage is provided by running the `era5_to_int.py` script with the `-h`/`--help`
argument, which prints the following:
```
usage: era5_to_int.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-i] datetime [until_datetime] [interval_hours]

positional arguments:
  datetime              the date-time to convert in YYYY-MM-DD_HH format
  until_datetime        the date-time in YYYY-MM-DD_HH format until which records are converted (Default:
                        datetime)
  interval_hours        the interval in hours between records to be converted (Default: 6)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH, --path PATH  the local path to search for ERA5 netCDF files
  -i, --isobaric        use ERA5 pressure-level data rather than model-level data
```

## Supplementary files

Included in this repository is a list of ECMWF vertical level coefficients in
the `ecmwf_coeffs` file. The `ecmwf_coeffs` file may be used with the WPS
`calc_ecmwf_p.exe` utility program to generate an intermediate file with 3-d
pressure, geopotential height, and R.H. fields from ERA5 model-level data.
